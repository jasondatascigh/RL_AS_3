# RL_AS_3

total reward was very low at very beginning, often the agent hits the red states and is penalized a lot.
As training continues, both SARSA and Q-learning rewards improve and start to stabilize.
Both algorithms performed similarly, learned going around the red wall along the bottom, which is the shortest safe path. Somtimes the reward would still drop.
